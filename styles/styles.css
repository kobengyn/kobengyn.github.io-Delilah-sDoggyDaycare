/* Did the math anyway to center the buttons to double check

the width of the entire page is 950px, and each box is 252px, along with the gap between them being 150px.
If we 950 px - ( 2 * 252 + 150 ) px = 296
296 is the amount of pixels remaining, if we divide it by 2 we'll get 148 which can distributed on both sides
however the css "justify content" suffices, given the it treats the buttons along with the gap as one big container, then centers it

    - items tagged with .top-margin will have 24 px of space above, and 12px of space below.
    - the "clear days" button will be 200px wide.
    - any element tagged with the .clicked class will turn mustard yellow. **This will be very important for your JavaScript.**

Width of the yellow bars are 950px wide, and the entire main is 600px wide
950px - 600px = 350px

the remaining 350 px we'll divide by 2 and add it to each side
350/2 = 175
therefore the margin is 175px left to center it
